The usage is pretty simple and straightforward.
Download the master file of this repository.
Upload and unzip to your WHMCS root installation folder.

## Notes:
* If you have customized your `admin` folder name, then you may want to pay attention to that. After you download the master file, unzip it on your PC first and open the folder to change the default name of the `admin` folder to match yours. Then re-compress and upload to your WHMCS install folder.
* This has been tested on WHMCS v7.9.2
* You can open `/assets/img/logo-dark.psd` to customize the logo to match your own brand if you wish.
